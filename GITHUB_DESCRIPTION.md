# Social Media Dashboard

A modern, responsive social media analytics dashboard built with React.js and Tailwind CSS. This comprehensive dashboard provides real-time analytics, engagement metrics, and insights across multiple social media platforms, helping you track and optimize your social media performance in one unified interface.

## Overview

This dashboard offers a complete solution for managing and analyzing your social media presence. With an intuitive, modern interface and powerful visualization tools, you can monitor key performance indicators, track audience growth, identify top-performing content, and stay updated with recent activities across all your connected platforms.

## Key Features

The dashboard includes real-time analytics that track essential metrics like total followers, reach, engagement rate, and comments. Interactive charts powered by Recharts visualize engagement trends and audience growth over time, making it easy to spot patterns and opportunities. The recent activity feed keeps you informed about the latest interactions, while the top posts section helps identify your best-performing content.

Multi-platform support is a core feature, allowing you to manage and analyze data from Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and YouTube all in one place. Each platform widget displays follower counts, engagement rates, post counts, and growth percentages, giving you a comprehensive view of your social media ecosystem.

The user interface is built with Tailwind CSS, ensuring a beautiful, modern design that's fully responsive and works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. The dashboard features a clean sidebar navigation, a header with search functionality, and a well-organized main content area that adapts to different screen sizes.

## Technology Stack

Built with React 18 using modern hooks and functional components, this project leverages Vite as the build tool for fast development and optimized production builds. Tailwind CSS provides utility-first styling for rapid UI development, while Recharts handles all chart visualizations with responsive, interactive graphs. React Icons supplies a comprehensive set of icons for all platform and UI elements.

## Getting Started

To get started, simply clone the repository, install dependencies with `npm install`, and run the development server using `npm run dev`. The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`. For production deployment, use `npm run build` to create optimized static files that can be deployed to any hosting service like Netlify or Vercel.

## Project Structure

The codebase is organized with a component-based architecture. The main Dashboard component orchestrates all sections, while individual components handle specific features like stats overview, platform widgets, charts, and activity feeds. This modular structure makes the code easy to understand, maintain, and extend.
